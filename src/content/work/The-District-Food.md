## Project Title: The District Food

**Description:**
"The District Food" is an online ordering platform dedicated to delivering delicious meals, providing users with an exceptional culinary experience. The project was developed using the Symfony framework, with a design focused on ease of use, cart management, and flexibility in managing dishes and categories.

**Key Features:**

1. **Online Ordering:**

   - Users can browse a diverse list of dishes offered by various restaurants.
   - Each dish is accompanied by a description, an enticing image, and the price.
   - A search system allows users to quickly find their favorite dishes.

2. **Cart Management:**

   - Users can add dishes to their shopping cart.
   - The cart is dynamic, allowing users to adjust quantities, remove items, and see the total amount in real-time.
   - The checkout process is user-friendly, with a detailed summary before confirmation.

3. **Dish CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete):**

   - Administrators can add new dishes to the platform, specifying the name, description, category, image, and price.
   - A user-friendly interface enables the update of existing dish details or their removal if necessary.
   - Form fields ensure data validation to maintain information integrity.

4. **Category CRUD:**
   - Categories group dishes based on their type (appetizers, main courses, desserts, etc.).
   - Administrators can create, modify, or delete categories, offering flexibility in organizing dishes.

**Technologies Used:**

- Symfony: PHP framework for web development.
- Doctrine: For database management and object-relational mapping.
- Twig: Template engine for creating views.
- Bootstrap: For responsive and attractive user interface design.

**Project Duration:**
The development of the "The District Food" project was completed in two weeks, demonstrating efficiency in planning, design, and implementation.

**Results and Future Prospects:**
The project resulted in the creation of a robust online ordering platform, providing a seamless user experience. Future improvements may include adding features such as user management, comments, and ratings to further enhance the overall experience.
